### Added

- Phase 0 / Phase 1 authority plan and product contracts

- Compatibility matrix and support states
- Cobra CLI with stable exit codes (`rein` / `reinstate`)
- Versioned config (TOML) and state (JSON) with atomic writes
- Device detection (macOS/Windows/Linux/WSL2; WSL1 refused)
- Redacted `doctor` / `setup check` and synthetic self-test
- Synthetic fixtures + secret scanner
- Hardened CI (fmt/vet/test/race/docs/fixtures/lint/security) and GoReleaser config
- Checksum-verifying installers (`scripts/install.sh`, `scripts/install.ps1`)
- Versioned AI-agent setup prompts under `docs/prompts/`
- S3-compatible backend client + memory test backend
- age scrypt envelopes with tamper/wrong-passphrase tests
- Path mapping, project identity, manifests, push/pull/conflicts
- Claude Code and Codex adapters (fixture-backed)
- Native OS-keyring credential storage and hidden TTY/file-descriptor passphrase input
- Streamed portable artifacts with authenticated metadata/hash validation
- Timestamped restore backups, mutation locks, profile isolation, and executable conflict resolution
- Active Claude Code/Codex process refusal before mutating session restores
- Cross-platform installer contract tests, release SBOMs, and artifact attestations
- Safe installer replacement checks, native Windows `rein.exe`, and release verification scripts
- Deterministic six-environment adapter fixtures and structured contributor/compatibility workflows

### Changed

- Relicensed core from MIT to **Apache License 2.0**
- README diagrams: ASCII boxes → Mermaid flowcharts
- Roadmap and support docs aligned to Phase 0 foundation + Phase 1 sessions
- Copy-paste setup prompts now continue through init, dry-run, sync, and restore verification
- Codex restores preserve date-partitioned rollout paths; both adapters fail closed on unverified versions

### Removed

- Invented `v0.0.0` changelog release history (no tag/release existed)
- Secret-bearing init flags, plaintext credential files, and ordinary environment passphrases
