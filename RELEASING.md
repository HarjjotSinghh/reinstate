# Releasing

How maintainers cut a **Reinstate** release.

## Versioning

- **Semantic Versioning**: `MAJOR.MINOR.PATCH`
- Pre-1.0: breaking changes allowed in `MINOR` with clear CHANGELOG entries
- Git tags are prefixed: `v0.1.0`

## Preconditions

- [ ] `main` is green on CI
- [ ] CHANGELOG `[Unreleased]` section is accurate
- [ ] No open P0 security issues
- [ ] For a stable release, macOS arm64, macOS amd64, native Windows amd64, and
      WSL2 acceptance rows pass
- [ ] For a release candidate, prior candidate failures are recorded and every
      known release blocker has a regression test or an explicit unresolved
      disposition
- [ ] Claude Code and Codex exact versions/layouts are recorded in compatibility docs
- [ ] Wrong-passphrase, tamper, backup, rollback, conflict, and installer tests pass
- [ ] Snapshot archives, source archive, checksums, and SBOMs were inspected
- [ ] Builds and vulnerability scans use the pinned Go 1.25.12 toolchain

## Steps

### 1. Prepare the release commit

```bash
# Update CHANGELOG and compatibility evidence.
make verify
goreleaser release --snapshot --clean
sh scripts/test-install.sh dist

git add --all
git commit -m "chore(release): vX.Y.Z"
git push -u origin release/vX.Y.Z
# Open a draft PR, pass protected-main CI, review, and merge.
```

### 2. Tag and push

```bash
export REINSTATE_SIGNING_KEY="$HOME/.ssh/reinstate_release_signing"
git -c gpg.format=ssh \
  -c user.signingkey="$REINSTATE_SIGNING_KEY" \
  tag -s vX.Y.Z -m "Reinstate vX.Y.Z"
git push origin vX.Y.Z
```

The tag must point at the reviewed commit on protected `main`. Do not move or
reuse a published tag. The matching public key and maintainer principal must
be present in `.github/allowed_signers` so CI can verify the signature without
depending on machine-local keyring state.

### 3. GitHub Release workflow

The release workflow builds binary and source archives, generates checksums and
per-binary-archive SBOMs, tests installer contracts, publishes a draft release,
and creates GitHub artifact attestations.

Before publishing the draft:

1. Confirm asset names match `reinstate_<version-without-v>_<os>_<arch>`.
2. Run both official installers against the exact draft assets.
3. Verify checksums and `gh attestation verify` for each archive.
4. Confirm archive contents include binary, license, notice, README, and changelog.
5. Mark prerelease tags as pre-release; publish stable only after every release gate.

### 4. Publish the public installer routes

Automatic Vercel Git deployments are disabled. After the GitHub release is
published, update a clean local `main` to the exact signed tag commit, link the
existing Vercel project if necessary, then run:

```bash
./scripts/deploy-website-production.sh vX.Y.Z
```

The script deploys without moving the production alias, verifies `install.sh`
and `install.ps1` against the exact tag at the immutable deployment URL,
promotes only that verified deployment, and verifies both live routes again.
Never run `vercel --prod` directly for a release.

For a release candidate, start the committed Mac/Windows acceptance prompts
only after both live routes install the new exact version.

### 5. Announce (optional)

- GitHub Discussions "Show and tell" / announcements
- X/Twitter [@HarjjotSinghh](https://x.com/HarjjotSinghh)
- Relevant community threads (only when the release is useful, not spam)

## Hotfix releases

1. Branch from the release tag if needed: `release/x.y`
2. Cherry-pick the fix
3. Bump **PATCH**, release as above
4. Merge back to `main`

## Rollback

Published releases are immutable. If a defect escapes, issue a new patch or
prerelease. Do not move the tag or replace assets.
