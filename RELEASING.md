# Releasing

How maintainers cut a **Reinstate** release.

## Versioning

- **Semantic Versioning**: `MAJOR.MINOR.PATCH`
- Pre-1.0: breaking changes allowed in `MINOR` with clear CHANGELOG entries
- Git tags are prefixed: `v0.1.0`

## Preconditions

- [ ] `main` is green on CI
- [ ] CHANGELOG `[Unreleased]` section is accurate
- [ ] No open P0 security issues
- [ ] For a stable release, macOS arm64, macOS amd64, native Windows amd64, and
      WSL2 acceptance rows pass
- [ ] For a release candidate, prior candidate failures are recorded and every
      known release blocker has a regression test or an explicit unresolved
      disposition
- [ ] Claude Code and Codex exact versions/layouts are recorded in compatibility docs
- [ ] Wrong-passphrase, tamper, backup, rollback, conflict, and installer tests pass
- [ ] Snapshot archives, source archive, checksums, and SBOMs were inspected
- [ ] Builds and vulnerability scans use the pinned Go 1.25.12 toolchain

### v0.2.0 platform exception

For `v0.2.0` only, the maintainer-approved reconciliation in
`docs/testing/results/2026-08-02-macos-phase2-V020RC2.md` permits stable
publication with verified support limited to Apple Silicon macOS
(`darwin/arm64`) and native Windows x64 (`windows/amd64`). Intel macOS and
Linux/WSL2 artifacts remain preview/unverified: they may be built, checksummed,
SBOM-covered, and attested, but must not be described as physically certified.

This exception does not satisfy or remove the normal four-environment
precondition for later stable releases. Issues #97 and #98 track the deferred
physical evidence.

## Steps

### 1. Prepare the release commit

```bash
# Update CHANGELOG and compatibility evidence.
make verify
goreleaser release --snapshot --clean
sh scripts/test-install.sh dist

git add --all
git commit -m "chore(release): vX.Y.Z"
git push -u origin release/vX.Y.Z
# Open a draft PR, pass protected-main CI, review, and merge.
```

### 2. Tag and push

```bash
export REINSTATE_SIGNING_KEY="$HOME/.ssh/reinstate_release_signing"
git -c gpg.format=ssh \
  -c user.signingkey="$REINSTATE_SIGNING_KEY" \
  tag -s vX.Y.Z -m "Reinstate vX.Y.Z"
git push origin vX.Y.Z
```

The tag must point at the reviewed commit on protected `main`. Do not move or
reuse a published tag. The matching public key and maintainer principal must
be present in `.github/allowed_signers` so CI can verify the signature without
depending on machine-local keyring state.

### 3. GitHub Release workflow

The release workflow builds binary and source archives, generates checksums and
per-binary-archive SBOMs, tests installer contracts, publishes a draft release,
and creates GitHub artifact attestations.

Before publishing the draft:

1. Confirm asset names match `reinstate_<version-without-v>_<os>_<arch>`.
2. Run both official installers against the exact draft assets.
3. Verify checksums and `gh attestation verify` for each archive.
4. Confirm archive contents include binary, license, notice, README, and changelog.
5. Mark prerelease tags as pre-release; publish stable only after every release gate.

Publishing the verified GitHub draft triggers **Publish package managers**.
That workflow re-verifies the signed tag, main ancestry, checksums, and GitHub
attestations before any enabled downstream job can run. Registry jobs are
opt-in and protected by the `package-publish` environment. Complete the account,
secret, repository-variable, and first-publication steps in
[Package-manager publishing](docs/package-manager-publishing.md) before enabling
them.

Stable releases may promote to npm, JSR, Homebrew, Chocolatey, Scoop, WinGet,
and AUR. Prereleases promote only to npm (`next`) and JSR. Do not publish a
registry package from a draft release or from locally rebuilt binaries.

For stable `v0.2.0`, complete both the **Stable v0.2.0 publication reminder**
and the **Post-publication documentation reminder** in
[Package-manager publishing](docs/package-manager-publishing.md). Enabled CI is
not evidence that a package is publicly listed, accepted by an external
registry, or verified on its native platform.

The GitHub draft now also contains raw binaries and `.deb`, `.rpm`, `.apk`, and
Arch package files. Confirm those files are covered by `checksums.txt` and
artifact attestations before publishing the draft.

### 4. Publish the public installer routes

Automatic Vercel Git deployments are disabled. After the GitHub release is
published, confirm both public bootstrap files pin that same release, update a
clean local `main`, and create a signed, annotated
`website-vYYYY.MM.DD.N` tag at the exact `origin/main` commit. Link the existing
Vercel project if necessary. Push the tag and wait for the
**Validate signed website deployment tag** workflow to pass, then run:

```bash
./scripts/deploy-website-production.sh website-vYYYY.MM.DD.N
```

The script derives the CLI release tag independently from `install.sh` and
`install.ps1`, refuses a mismatch, and verifies that release before it deploys.
It deploys without moving the production alias, verifies both installers
against the derived CLI release at the immutable deployment URL, promotes only
that verified deployment, and verifies both live routes again. Never run
`vercel --prod` directly for a release.

For a release candidate, start the committed four-environment acceptance
dispatch only after both live routes install the new exact version. Native
macOS arm64 and native Windows amd64 own the complete two-device matrix; native
macOS amd64 and WSL2 amd64 provide the separate stable-platform evidence
required by the preconditions above.

### 5. Publish website-only changes

A website deployment is not a CLI release. Use a signed, annotated
`website-vYYYY.MM.DD.N` deployment tag when reviewed website changes need to
ship without advancing the current Reinstate version. The website tag must
point at the exact current `origin/main` commit; it must not be published as a
GitHub Release or described as a new CLI version.

The public installer identity remains explicit inside both committed bootstrap
files. The script derives their CLI release tag, requires them to agree, and
verifies the corresponding published release. Push the website tag and wait
for the **Validate signed website deployment tag** workflow to pass before
running:

```bash
./scripts/deploy-website-production.sh website-vYYYY.MM.DD.N
```

For example, while Reinstate remains current:

```bash
./scripts/deploy-website-production.sh website-v2026.07.28.1
```

The guarded script verifies the website tag signature, requires it to match
clean local `main` and `origin/main`, verifies the derived signed CLI release,
and requires both committed public installers to match that release before
deploying. It then applies the same immutable-deployment checks, installer byte
comparisons, production discovery smoke tests, promotion, and live-origin
verification. A `website-v...` tag does not satisfy or replace any CLI release,
compatibility, or acceptance gate.

### 6. Announce (optional)

- GitHub Discussions "Show and tell" / announcements
- X/Twitter [@HarjjotSinghh](https://x.com/HarjjotSinghh)
- Relevant community threads (only when the release is useful, not spam)

## Hotfix releases

1. Branch from the release tag if needed: `release/x.y`
2. Cherry-pick the fix
3. Bump **PATCH**, release as above
4. Merge back to `main`

## Rollback

Published releases are immutable. If a defect escapes, issue a new patch or
prerelease. Do not move the tag or replace assets.
