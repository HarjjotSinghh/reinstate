# Reinstate Hop: sign-in and devices

Reinstate Hop is the paid hosted tier: a locker (a storage bucket provisioned
for exactly one account, holding only ciphertext) plus a console. Every client
capability stays in the free CLI; Hop gates storage and the console only. This
page covers the first piece that has landed in the client: passwordless
sign-in and device tokens. Locker provisioning, pairing, and the daemon follow.

## Commands

```text
rein login [--email ADDRESS] [--no-browser] [--json]
rein whoami [--json]
```

`rein login` signs this device in. With no flag it starts a GitHub sign-in:
the CLI prints a URL, opens it in your browser, and waits. With
`--email you@example.com` the control plane sends a one-time link to that
address instead; open it on any device to approve this one. Either way, no
password exists or is ever asked for.

On approval the control plane enrols this machine as a **device** under your
**account** and issues a device token. The token is stored in the OS keyring
(macOS Keychain, Windows Credential Manager, or the supported Linux
provider), never in a file under `~/.reinstate`. `rein whoami` presents it
and prints the account, the device, and the control plane it is bound to.

Exit codes follow the usual contract: `2` for a malformed address, `4`
(`auth_storage`) when the device is not signed in or its token was rejected,
`1` for an unreachable control plane or an expired sign-in.

## Choosing the control plane

The production control plane is `https://hop.reinstate.dev`. Override it for
staging or a local build with, in order of precedence:

1. `REINSTATE_HOP_URL=http://127.0.0.1:8080`
2. `[hop] url = "..."` in `config.toml` (sign-in works before `rein init`; the
   section is optional)

The URL a device signed in against travels with its token, so `rein whoami`
always asks the control plane that issued the token.

## Protocol

The client is open and the protocol is public; the control plane's source is
private. The control plane never receives a root key, a recovery code, a
passphrase, or session content. Sign-in is a device-authorization style flow:

| Step | Request | Answer |
| ---- | ------- | ------ |
| 1 | `POST /v1/login/sessions` `{method: "github"\|"email", email?, device: {name, platform}}` | `201 {session_id, poll_secret, verification_url?, expires_at, interval_seconds}`. For `email` the link is mailed, not returned. |
| 2 | Browser opens `verification_url` (GitHub OAuth) or the emailed link | The emailed link shows an "Approve this device?" form on `GET`; enrolment happens only on its `POST`, so mail link scanners that prefetch the link neither sign anyone in nor burn it. The control plane creates the account on first sight and enrols the device in one transaction. Each link works once and expires with the session. |
| 3 | `POST /v1/login/sessions/{id}/poll` `{poll_secret}` | `200 {status: "pending"}` until approved; then exactly once `200 {status: "approved", device_token, account, device}`; afterwards `410 {status: "consumed"}`. Past `expires_at`: `410 {status: "expired"}`. Wrong secret: `404`. |
| 4 | `GET /v1/whoami` with `Authorization: Bearer <device_token>` | `200 {account, device}`; unknown or revoked token: `401`. |

Device tokens are 256-bit random values prefixed `hop_`. The control plane
stores only a hash, bound to one device record (name, platform, created, last
seen). The CLI sends no telemetry; the control plane records `sign_up` and
`device_enrolled` events as its only product metrics.

## What this does not do yet

- Provision a locker or mint storage credentials (`rein sync` still needs BYO
  storage).
- Pair devices, generate the root key, or show a recovery code.
- Revoke a device or sign out.
